Review : 1 : Recommended::N/A | outLook::N/A | CEO: N/A| Pros: Work from home, coworkers are nice, benefits package ok| Cons: A lot of employees have the "not my job" mentality and are quick to pass the ball to someone else. Annual raise doesn't even cover inflation rate. Consistently given more and more work but annual review always "meets expectations". Although "meets expectations" not given full bonus; only response from manager is "I did what I could". Advancement opportunities slim to none, if you don't know the right people (wrong people keep getting promoted)
Review : 2 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: some good people, flexibility to work from home, very little oversight so you can basically do nothing and nobody would know| Cons: No direction or vision.

Review : 7 : Recommended::Recommends | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: Approves of CEO| Pros: Friendly environment in the office I work in and my teammates.| Cons: There is no accountability in so many departments. Everyone is trying to get others to do their work for them all the time. Pay vs workload is near the bottom for a lot of jobs so employees always leaving.
Review : 8 : Recommended::Recommends | outLook::Positive Outlook | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: Great people (for the most part) in management and coaching Benefits and pension options Work events Community support events| Cons: Management structure was lacking organization No clear path for long term career development Seeing some of the best benefits and pension plans available in the country, easy to realize ours was not very great Job did not pay well enough for workload and variety of things to learn and have to remember to implement depending on who calls when
Review : 9 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::N/A | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: - Majority of the staffs are friendly - Can meet many people working in or heading towards the field of psychology - flexible hours after complete the training - If you sell well, meet all the targets, you can be promoted fairly quickly - Benefits are pretty good for this type of salary - great place to gain entry experience and knowledge for the field of counselling| Cons: - Very sales based position, sales &gt; client need, even though they are providing mental health related service. - expecting taking 40-50 + calls a day during busy season - work environment isn't too flexible, you washroom, lunch and all other break time is strictly calculated and monitored.

Review : 10 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Negative Outlook | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: Great flexibility in schedules - various shifts available Various locations x Canada and abroad Mobility| Cons: Do not cover mental health claims while boasting largest mental health consulting firm in Canada Low salaries for some EEs / Customer service Poor benefits Little vacation, sick days No specific training for people leaders, who get away with bad behaviour, judgementalism Unequal quality in people leaders due to lack of training and favouritism

Review : 13 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: Disapproves of CEO| Pros: Some good people to work with at most levels in most teams. Dress codes have been relaxed over the years which is nice. Management is open to new ideas and rarely shoots down something without giving it a reasonable chance.| Cons: Severly understaffed in many areas. Way too much reliance on individual resources for many tasks with no backup. Business is at a huge risk of coming to a grinding halt in many areas should key staff ever leave, but it's also how costs are kept down. Recently allowed anonymous feedback and questions in all employee calls, but decided while on a full court press to improve engagement scores that allowing people to safely & honestly share their feedback without repercussions wasn't desirable. Now forces everyone to identify themselves to ensure that the Senior Leadership only gets positive questions. Not sure how they think that will lead to higher instead of lower scores. Also seems to think that when they do something people don't like if they could just explain it right people would agree with them. Doesn't seem able to understand that they don't always know & do what's best for employees no matter how often the employees explain to them that they're not happy with certain things.

Review : 29 : Recommended::Recommends | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: Disapproves of CEO| Pros: amazing, hard working colleagues lots of opportunity to help shape products and services career advancement is possible - comes at cost always lots of change - which can be exciting for a while| Cons: morale has never been lower in my 6yrs with the company. Previous CEO said very little and in turn little was done for staff which many didn't like. Current CEO says a ton, but nothing is done; its all filler to get through the all employee call. It might be better to say nothing? The constant change forces people to constantly pivot WHO they are and what they are doing to match whomever is in charge.

Review : 33 : Recommended::N/A | outLook::N/A | CEO: N/A| Pros: The people are nice, if boring. Depending on what department you work in, you are actually helping people, e.g. counselling.| Cons: The company works in some serious silos so that it's difficult to know what other people are working on and hard to push your projects ahead in terms of priorities. The client value proposition of helping employees feel more engaged can feel bitterly ironic at times. People often feel like they are the "shoemaker's children".
Review : 34 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Positive Outlook | CEO: Approves of CEO| Pros: Inspiring vision and strategy from Executive Leadership.| Cons: Below Executive level, leadership doesn't live the values of the company. VP decision makers are rarely focused on client service. Primary focus is on cost containment. Leadership has a significant Toronto bias that it brings to the rest of the world. Morneau Shepell aspires to be a global wellness company but doesn't have the right people in the right roles to accomplish this goal.
Review : 35 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: Ability to work from home.

Review : 48 : Recommended::Doesn't Recommend | outLook::Negative Outlook | CEO: No opinion of CEO| Pros: - I worked for Morneau Shepell Children's Support Solutions as a behaviour therapist. The work environment is very laid back, you can have your breaks whenever you want (either with your clients or alone on your scheduled lunch break). - The senior therapists are rarely on site so there aren't many authority figures breathing down your neck. - This is a job that is good for recent grads who need job experience so that they can then move on to a better ABA centre. - The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with a diverse range of clients (ie: high and low-functioning ASD, ages 2-17). Home sessions are a gamble - sometimes you get a really good family and other times you don't. They will only make you do home sessions if you have a personal vehicle.| Cons: - The hardest part about the job was not having a lot of training and supervision when it came to crisis prevention. If you have a client that is aggressive, you don't get much support from your senior therapists. - The pay is not that great ($17-20 hourly) with no benefits or vacation days. If your client cancels with more than 24 hrs notice, you do not get paid for that session. However, if the client cancels with less than 24 hrs you can collect 50%. Your income is never consistent. - Everyone is asked if they can work evenings and weekends. I chose to work evenings but not weekends because I needed to consider my work-life balance.

Review : 57 : Recommended::Recommends | outLook::Neutral Outlook | CEO: Approves of CEO| Pros: Colleagues care about their peers in most instances which creates families and positive relationships within teams and practice units. Flexibility .| Cons: Flexibility because it creates blurred lines with staff. We need stricter management policies which say outside of 8-5, delay send must be used or work offline so staff don't feel they have to be working and on all the time. This message should be especially enforced at Director, manager, supervisor level and cascaded from SLT.
